# Gallerify - your image repository

Explore a selection of the best photos, images, designs, and illustrations; shop the most eye-catching items and add them to your repository :)

## Technologies

This app was built with Django

## What I learned
- Build an e-shop web application featuring user authentication, product page, shopping cart, and check out modules

- Support switching between guest and user by adding cookies

- Define models and views, design templates, and implement routing with Django framework

- Manage site with Django admin page

- Leveraged Paypal to support payments; add theft prevention during checkout

## Features
Home Page (owner put custom watermarkes on the items, no image theft:)
